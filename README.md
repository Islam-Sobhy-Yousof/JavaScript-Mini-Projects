# JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript mini projects repository! This repository contains a collection of mini projects that I've created as part of my learning journey.

## Overview

This repository serves as a compilation of small JavaScript projects that I've built to practice and reinforce my programming skills. Each project focuses on a specific concept or feature of JavaScript, allowing me to experiment and learn in a hands-on manner.

## Projects

Below is a list of the mini projects included in this repository:

- [MadZoo](madZoo/): A fun JavaScript game where you can shoot animals and gain score with animations and sound effects.
